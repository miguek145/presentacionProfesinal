                <p>I have experience in JavaScript, including handling asynchronous programming with AJAX and jQuery for efficient communication with servers. In addition, I am proficient in error handling, the use of JavaScript functions, as well as the manipulation of JSON files with map.

                    I am also skilled in event handling, control structures and the use of JavaScript functions to interact with the DOM structure. In addition, I apply Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles to develop modular and reusable code.

                    About HTML and CSS, mastering techniques such as Flexbox and Grid to create responsive and structured designs. In addition, I handle the use of IDs, classes and pseudoclasses, allowing a better organization and customization of the style in my projects.
                    
                    I also have knowledge in CSS transitions and animations, which allows me to add dynamic effects and improve the user experience. You can see some of my projects in the design section, where I apply these skills to develop attractive and functional interfaces.</p>

                <p>I have experience in SQL, having created and managed databases from design to implementation. I am proficient in DDL (Data Definition Language) and DML (Data Manipulation Language) for data creation, modification and manipulation.

                    In addition, I know how to design entity-relationship (ER) diagrams and the relational model, ensuring well-structured and optimized databases. I have worked with database management systems such as MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL, using advanced queries, including INNER JOIN, to efficiently relate and extract data.</p>

                <p>I have knowledge in frameworks such as Bootstrap, Laravel and Tailwind CSS, which I use to streamline development and improve the structure of my projects.

                    With Bootstrap, I have worked on the creation of dynamic components, such as an interactive carousel with three static images, optimizing the visual presentation.
                    
                    In Laravel, I use it mainly for data pagination and form validation using regular expressions, especially in modules like LOGIN and REGISTER, ensuring security and efficiency.
                    
                    On the other hand, I use Tailwind CSS to apply predefined classes in HTML elements, such as alerts and other components, which allows me to develop modern interfaces in a fast and flexible way.</p>
